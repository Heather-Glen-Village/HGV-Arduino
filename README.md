The Code Created for by me for the for communcation with Arduino Board Using Modbus and RS485


## Arduino Code
all Arduino code can be found in either the Primary, Secondary-1 or Secondary-2 folder where the current uploaded code goes or to the Code-Collection where past working code goes or other useful code that need to be stored way

all of this was made using the Arduino Community Extension on VS Code

## Python Code
The python code was build for handling the data when outside of the Arduino Board after they are sending the infromation out with a ethernet port. in the folder you can find working Modbus Server, Clinet and DB and a major file that connects them all together.
